"VOID"

A project for CS252 by Nathan Scott, Jacob McKesson, and Jacob Stucky

The project is based off of the game asteroids, with updated sprites and gameplay.

The project used a trial version of IBM's bluemix, which has since expired, rendering the storage of high scores useless.

Completed December 2015.
